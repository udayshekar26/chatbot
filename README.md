**Software and Hardware Requirement specification**

A software requirements specification (SRS) is a description of a software system to be developed. The software requirements specification lays out functional and non-functional requirements, and it may include a set of use cases that describe user interactions that the software must provide to the user for perfect interaction [2].

Software requirements specification establishes the basis for an agreement between customers and contractors or suppliers on how the software product should function (in a market-driven project, these roles may be played by the marketing and development divisions). Software requirements specification is a rigorous assessment of requirements before the more specific system design stages, and its goal is to reduce later redesign. It should also provide a realistic basis for estimating product costs, risks, and schedules.

The software and hardware requirement specification provides a clear understanding of the software and hardware components needed for the successful development and deployment of the Chat Bot project. It helps guide the development team in selecting the appropriate technologies and ensures that the system can run efficiently on the intended target platforms.

**User Interface**
	
The user interface of the Chat Bot project is designed to provide a user-friendly and interactive chat experience. It consists of various elements that allow users to communicate with the bot and receive responses. Here are the details of the user interface components:

Chat Bar:The chat bar is a collapsible element located at the bottom right corner of the screen. It serves as a control to expand and collapse the chat window. When collapsed, it displays a button with the text "Chat with us!" and an icon indicating the chat feature. Clicking on the button expands the chat window.


Chat Window:The chat window is the main area where the conversation between the user and the bot takes place. It is contained within a rectangular block and has a fixed position at the bottom right of the screen. The chat window has a stylish and clean design to enhance the user experience.


User Input:The user input section is located at the bottom of the chat window. It consists of an input box where users can type their messages to interact with the bot. The input box has a placeholder text, "Tap 'Enter' to send a message," which provides instructions to the user. Users can press the enter key or click the send button to submit their messages.


Chat Messages:The chat messages section is the central part of the chat window where user and bot messages are displayed. User messages are aligned to the right, indicating the user's side of the conversation, while bot messages are aligned to the left, representing the bot's responses. Each message is contained within a colored bubble with rounded corners to differentiate between user and bot messages. The messages are displayed in a conversation-like format, with the most recent messages appearing at the bottom and older messages scrolling upwards.


Timestamp:The timestamp section is located above the chat messages. It displays the current time to provide a reference for when the messages were sent or received. The timestamp is updated dynamically as new messages are added to the chat.


Icons:The chat window includes two icons on the right side of the user input section. The first icon is a heart icon, which users can click to send a predefined message. The second icon is a send icon, represented by a paper airplane, which users can click to submit their typed messages. These icons add visual appeal and provide alternative options for sending messages.


Styling and Responsiveness:The user interface is designed using CSS to provide a visually pleasing and responsive layout. The chat window and input box have appropriate padding and spacing to ensure readability and ease of use. The interface is responsive and adjusts its layout and sizing based on different screen sizes and device types, providing a consistent experience across various devices.


**Implementation**
	
The index.html file serves as the entry point for the project. It includes the necessary HTML structure for the chat interface, such as buttons, input fields, and message containers. It also imports external CSS and JavaScript files.

The chat.css file defines the visual appearance of the chat interface. It specifies the layout, colors, and animations for different chat elements, such as user and bot messages, input box, and icons.

The home.css file sets the background color and font family for the home page, providing a cohesive visual style.

The chat.js file contains the JavaScript code responsible for the chat functionality. It handles user interactions, such as clicking buttons, submitting messages, and pressing the enter key. It also manages the display of user and bot messages, retrieves bot responses based on user input from the responses.js file, and scrolls the chat window as messages are added.

The responses.js file contains a function that analyzes the user's input and generates an appropriate response from the bot. It includes predefined responses for specific keywords and performs basic calculations for input starting with "calculate".



The JavaScript code attaches event listeners to the collapsible buttons to handle opening and closing of the chat box.

The getTime() function retrieves the current time and is used to display a timestamp for each message.

The firstBotMessage() function initializes the chat by displaying the bot's initial greeting message.

The getHardResponse() function generates and displays the bot's response based on user input.

The getResponse() function is triggered when the user sends a message. It retrieves the user's input, appends it to the chat box, and calls the getHardResponse() function after a 1-second delay.

The buttonSendText() function is called when the user clicks on the heart icon. It appends a specific message to the chat box.

The sendButton() function is triggered when the user clicks on the send icon. It calls the getResponse() function.

The $("#textInput").keypress() event listener allows the user to send a message by pressing the Enter key.
